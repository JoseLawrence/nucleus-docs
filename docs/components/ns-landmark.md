# ns-landmark

## Introduction

> Landmarks are used to introduce the page, informing users of their current location and its primary purpose.

Landmarks can be used to set the scene for what the page is for, what offers might be available and give helpful best next actions for users. This is where the main heading for the page will sit and give the overarching context to the rest of the page.

## Usage

| field-type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| sub-heading | sub-headings are used to indicate the primary section or to reinforce a brand message. Short and simple words tend to work better and it is recommended to keep the length between 1 and 5 words |
| heading | The recommended length is between 4 and 12 words, not exceeding 50 characters in total. Headings contain light and bold font weight to highlight key messaging. |
| paragraph | A single, short paragraph works best |
| caveat | Should be placed at the end of the paragraph if necessary |
| cta-text | Keep them â€˜short, relevant, and actionableâ€™ It should not exceed more than 24 characters |
| cta-link | This is the URL that the user will be taken too when they tap or click the CTA. |
| image-path | This is the image that will be used inside the ns-landmark. Ensure the important focus area of your image remains within the safe-area. It should have an aspect ratio of 16:9, the dimensions should be 1440x810 px, the file type should be jpg, and the file size should be no more than 150kb. Please make sure you work with a designer when selecting this image as finding the right one with the correct focus area can be challenging. |
