# Marketing consent

## Introduction

> Marketing consent is the capture of a customer's contact preferences for marketing purposes.

This experience pattern should be used in any journey where customer marketing preferences are **captured.**  
This component is _only_ used to capture and submit customer preferences, not view or change existing preferences.

## Content Guidance

You should not change the title or the opening paragraph copy as these have been signed off by the legal team.
If there is an updated version of this copy that has been issued & signed off by legal, then please inform Nucleus so that the default copy in the component can be updated.

## Best practice

This component is legally required when capturing contact preferences that will be used for marketing purposes.

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always keep the same options. | Reorder the options. |
| Use at the end of a journey that captures contact information used for marketing purposes. | Use when collecting contact information that will be used solely for a service offering e.g. Booking an engineer. |
| Always use inside of an `ns-form` component. | Add a decoration. |
| Use _only_ once per journey. | Have any of the options pre-checked. |
