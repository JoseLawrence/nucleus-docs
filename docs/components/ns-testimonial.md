# ns-testimonial

## Introduction

A new component to display all the lovely things that customers say about us. The customer testimonial should be used as an enticement to buy British Gas products and services. It works by providing the customer with confidence.

## Best practice

| üíö Do | üíî Don't |
| :---  | :---  |
| Use a single sentence | Use multiple paragraphs |
| Use `<b>` to highlight key phrases | Link to a live twitter handle |
| Use positive feedback | Include anything negative, rude or which may be misconstrued  |
| | Include any personal information beyond first name or twitter handle |

### Considerations of best practice


## Usage

```markup
<ns-testimonial citeUrl="https://url-where-the-quote-comes-from" author="Dave" medium="twitter">
  <p slot="quote">Quote text <b>emphasised text</b></p>
</ns-testimonial>
```
