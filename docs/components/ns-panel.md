# ns-panel

## Introduction

Think of `ns-panel` as an empty container for each section of a page. Each `ns-panel` provides an area to place a layout and add an optional decoration.

Decorating a panel with a gradient background provides separation from the other sections of the page and introduces brand colour and style. Including the circle provides subtle emphasis.

## Usage

To see examples visit [Storybook](https://nucleus.bgdigital.xyz/demo/index.html?path=/story/playground-panels--lockup-decoration-panel&knob-Decoration=invert-concave-cyan)

```html
<ns-panel>
  ...
</ns-panel>
```

## Component Relationship

- `ns-panel` is always a child of the `<main>` element

## Best practises

| âœ… Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| ------ | -------- |
|   Alternate with and without the use of decoration     |    Don't add a decoration to every `ns-panel`    |
|   Use appropriate colour for purpose of page in decorations     |    Nest a panel in a panel      |
|   Include more than one layout in a `ns-panel`    |      |


### Considerations of best practises

- Treat each `ns-panel` as a section of the page
- Include no more than two `ns-lockups` in an `ns-panel` with a decoration
- Examples of a layout would be: `.splash` or an `ns-lockup`
