## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Communicate the message in a clear and concise way as possible. Ideally, it should be able to be explained in the heading in one sentence, where possible | Use it for page specific messages |
| Use inline text links into supporting content if necessary | Use if for non-important messages |
| Only add additional information in the expanded copy if necessary | Make the message longer than necessary |
| Add inline links to aid the user to helpful information where possible | Use for error messaging |
| Add the icon that matches to the context of the message; warning or information | |

### Considerations of best practice

* Use sparingly for only the most important information
* Not be used as the primary entry point to information or actions users need on a regular basis.
* Do not use for marketing information or up sell
