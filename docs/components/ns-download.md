# ns-download

## Introduction

> Highlights an item that can be downloaded.

Currently only allows '.pdf' and '.xls' file types, other types can be added but it will require a new release.

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |
| :---  | :---  |
| Use for all downloads | Use the instructions in the body e.g. 'download here'|
| Include file size | Don't describe the file as a file |
| Describe what the file is |  |
| Place in a list element with class `download-list` when you have more than 1 download link in row|  |

### Considerations of best practice

Include file size - this is particularly nice for customers that are on reduced data allowences (i.e. mobile), and also offers an indication on how long a file might take to download.

Text Content - the text provided between the ns-download tags is used to create the filename for the downloaded file. This helps users identify the file that has been downloaded.

The download-list class can only be used on `<ul>` and `<ol>` html tags. Each ns-download must be a direct child of a `<li>`.

### Accessibility

In order to comply with accessibility standards you should not force a file to open in a new tab. It must be left up to the user to decide whether to download a file, or open in a new tab.

The one exception to this rule is in forms as there are often challenges around caching user data. When ns-download is used within ns-form; if the browser can display the file type it will open in a new tab.
