# ns-download

## Introduction

> Highlights an item that can be downloaded.

Currently only allows '.pdf' file types, other types can be added but it will require a new release.

## Best practice

| üíö Do | üíî Don't |
| :---  | :---  |
| Use for all downloads | Use the instructions in the body e.g. 'download here'|
| Include file size |  |
| Describe what the file is |  |

### Considerations of best practice

Include file size - this is particularly nice for customers that are on reduced data allowences (i.e. mobile), and also offers an indication on how long a file might take to download

Text Content - the text provided between the ns-download tags is used to create the filename for the downloaded file. This helps users identify the file that has been downloaded.

## Usage
