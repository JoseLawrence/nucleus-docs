## Introduction

> Cards give users a set of options for users to choose from

Cards give a story about why the user should go to the next action. This can be done through imagery, illustrations and typography. They can nudge users to a specific subject or area.

## Best practises

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Always use them in the triple layout | Use the text CTA in the section card |
| Use to direct customers to the actions | Use the key CTA in any of the cards |
| Embolden text in the paragrah that is important | Mix card types in a row |
| Make your CTA copy unique, stating the action | Have two or more cta's for a card |
| Use section cards to navigate users to primary actions | Repeat the CTA copy in each card |
| Consider using decoration in the panel to add emphasis on the cards | Use inline links in the paragraph |
| | Use the section card without a decoration |

### Considerations of best practises

* Consider your CTA type and try to keep them consistent between rows across the cards, unless there is a need.
* There can be less than three cards in a row, but it should always use the triple layout. Always consider a lockup for this, before using the cards.
* Headings work best with one to four words.
* Please check the imagery guidlines when adding an image to the card.
* Be careful when using decoration in the panel with the section cards as the blue on blue with the CTA's will make them not accessible.
* There should always be a heading to the group of cards inside the panel.
