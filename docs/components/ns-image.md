## Best practises

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Dont's |
| :--- | :--- |
| Resize your image \(\[see optimise your image \(LINK\)\] | Use images as the primary content |
| Use the correct image format png/jpg | Put text inside the image |
| Use brand approved images | Use a white background in images |
| Think about the image responsive behaviour |  |
|  |  |

### Considerations of best practices

* Reduce images to the smallest size that does not degrade the image too much where it becomes distracting to the customer.
* The components that hold images will take care of the rounded corners and any masking or overlaying of illustrations. Read about the component you wish to use with the image.
* Always use this component to add images to the website.
