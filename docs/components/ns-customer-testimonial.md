# ns-customer-testimonial **EXPERIMENTAL**

## Introduction

> **EXPERIMENTAL** This component is currently under development.

A new component to display all the lovely things that customers say about us. The customer testimonial should be used as an enticement to buy British Gas products and services. It works by providing the customer with confidence.

## Best practice

| 💚 Do | 💔 Don't |
| :---  | :---  |
| Use a single sentence | Use multiple paragraphs |
| Use `<b>` to highlight keyphrases | Link to a live twitter handle |
| Use positive feedback | Include anything negative, rude or which may be misconstrued  |
| | Include any personal information beyond first name or twitter handle |

### Considerations of best practice
