## Introduction

> Ns-slot-picker is used to allow the user to select a time slot from one or more dates and time slots.

Ns-slot-picker is used any time you want a customer to select a time slot. This would typically be used for booking an appointment.  It can display time slots for a single day or multiple days.

```
const slots = [{
