## Introduction

> Highlighters can be used to communicate information or error, warning and success messages.

A component that communicates the message that a service is not available to them or that there are technical issues on specific pages only. These messages are different to global messages as they only apply to some pages not site wide e.g. a message that says the top up service is not available would only apply to pages that customers will look at in order to top up.

## Content guidance

| Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| Heading      |  |
| Paragraph    |  |

## Best practice

| üíö Do's | üíî Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Keep the messages concise |  Use for generic message that is not in context to the page it is displayed in |
| Use an icon to alert the user what type of message it is |  Use it for error messaging |

### Considerations of best practice

* Be clear and concise

The message must be in plain English, and help the user out of the situation by providing an actionable link if possible.
