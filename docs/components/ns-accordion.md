# ns-accordion

## Introduction

> Accordion enables users to expand and collapse sections of content.

We use accordions to break down information or to link content to other pages through text links.â€¨

## Usage

- We use accordions to break down information or to link content to other pages through text links.â€¨
- Accordions allow us to reduce the information overload by using progressive disclosure.
- Having the collapsed and expandable state, helps the user to read or find information that is divided by a meaningful order or area.
- Accordions are useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of content such as tariffs.
- We don't use key/important information in accordions.
