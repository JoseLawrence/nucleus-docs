# ns-accordion

## Introduction

> Accordion enables users to expand and collapse sections of content.

We use accordions to break down information or to link content to other pages through text links.â€¨

## Usage

- We use accordions to break down information or to link content to other pages through text links.â€¨
- Accordions allow us to reduce the information overload by using progressive disclosure.
- Having the collapsed and expandable state, helps the user to read or find information that is divided by a meaningful order or area.
- Accordions are useful for things like frequently asked questions or displaying multiple blocks of content such as tariffs.
- We don't use key/important information in accordions.

## Specification

| **Name** | validate |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Description** | validates all of the fields within the form and returns an object containing the field and validation data |
| **Type** | Function |
| **Default** | n/a |
| **Options** | n/a |

An **invalid validate return response** looks like:

```javascript
{
  "isValid": false,
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    }
  ],
  "fieldsByName": {
    "email-address": {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    },
    "password": {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": false,
      "value": "",
      "error": "This field is required",
      "input": {}
    }
  }
}
```

A **valid validate return response** looks like:

```javascript
{
  "isValid": true,
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "hello@example.com",
      "input": {}
    },
    {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "password12",
      "input": {}
    }
  ],
  "fieldsByName": {
    "email-address": {
      "name": "email-address",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "hello@example.com",
      "input": {}
    },
    "password": {
      "name": "password",
      "isValid": true,
      "value": "password12",
      "input": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practises

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use `ns-inputter` for your form fields | Don't write your own validations |
| Use `ns-cta` to submit your form | Don't rely on front end validation alone. |

### Considerations of best practises

* Alyways use the `ns-inputter` component inside `ns-form`, input and other form elements shouldn't be on their own.
* Speak with the Nucleus team for advice on experience patterns.
