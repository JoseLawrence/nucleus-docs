# nsx-footer

## Introduction

> The required links and information for each page of the British Gas website.

> NOTE: This is the experience pattern for the footer. If you are looking to use a footer with different links (why?) please use `ns-footer`.

This experience pattern is a wrapper of the `ns-footer` and holds the links that are legally required for the website. If a link needs to be updated for the website footer, it needs to be done in this experience pattern.

## Best practice

| 💚 Do's | 💔 Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Keep it at the bottom of the page as the last element. | Make your own footer if you are part of the customer facing website. |
| Keep the footer outside the `main` element |  |


## Usage

To see examples visit [Storybook](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/nucleus-experiences/demo/index.html?path=/story/nsx-footer--standard).


```markup
<nsx-footer></nsx-footer>
```
