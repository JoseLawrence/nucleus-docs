## Introduction

> The Timeline Event component represents a sequence of events that happen within a process, and shows the status.

It gives an overview of the whole process and progress of a customer journey. Its main purpose is to create situational awareness for the user and define expectations.

* Provides the customer with visibility on the status of a process or system in their journey

* Gives a top-level overview of the process

* It's clear to understand and mangages expectations by showing the current situation to the user

## Content guidance

The status of the event is controlled by the decoration used.

### Pending Event `status="pending"`

Communicates that the event has yet to commence.

### In progress Event `status="inprogress"`

Indicates that progress is currently being made on this step.

### Action Required Event `status="actionrequired"`

This is used when a customer needs to take action in order to proceed with the process.

### Warning Event `status="warning"`

Informs of a problem with low severity such as foreseeable delays or outages etc. The problem is expected to be automatically resolved as the situation changes.

### Error Event `status="error"`

This is a failure indication. Something couldn't be resolved and so has halted the whole process. It should be accompanied by a helpful message.

### Completed Event `status="completed"`

The event has been successfully completed.

### Cancelled Event `status="cancelled"`

If an error event has occurred, all subsequent events 
have been been cancelled. The process will not be completed.

## Best practice

### Considerations of best practice

* Only use inside `ns-timeline` as a slot of `event`.

## Component placement

<ComponentPlacement component="ns-timeline-event" parentComponents="ns-timeline"></ComponentPlacement>
