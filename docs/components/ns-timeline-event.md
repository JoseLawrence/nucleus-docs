## Introduction

> The Timeline Event component represents a sequence of events that happen within a process and shows the status.

It gives an overview of the whole process and progress of a customer journey. Its main purpose is to create situational awareness for the user and define expectations.

* Provides the customer with visibility on the status of a process or system in their journey

* Gives a top-level overview of the process

* It's clear to understand and manages expectations by showing the current situation to the user



## Content guidance

The decoration for the event is dependent on the status of the event.

### Pending Event `status="pending"`

For communicating that the event is waiting for previous event(s) to be completed.

### In progress Event `status="inprogress"`

For communicating that the event is currently making progress.

### Action Required Event `status="actionrequired"`

For communicating that the event expects customer to carry out an action to make progress.

### Warning Event `status="warning"`

For communicating problems of less severity like foreseeable delay, failure, outage, etc..

### Error Event `status="error"`

For communicating failure with urgence.

### Completed Event `status="completed"`

For communicating that the event has been successful.

### Cancelled Event `status="cancelled"`
For communicating that the progress of the event has been halted due to error in other event(s) in the timeline sequence.
