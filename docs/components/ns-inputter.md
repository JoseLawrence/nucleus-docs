| Use as a prompt | |

### Placeholder

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |

### Validation

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use only when required | Use real data |
| Only use to validate the format of the input | Don't used for... |

### Text Input

### Considerations of best practices

* Use defined conventions for common fields
* Use standard examples for placeholder copy
* If you are asking for first and last name within a text input, spell check should be disabled
* Refer to the text input auto complete definitions
* Always try and have a default selected radio button unless....
