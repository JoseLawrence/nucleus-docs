# Address Selector

## Introduction

> This experience pattern should be used in any journey where the user needs to select a premise or enter an address.

The Address Selector allows a user to select a single address from a list of premises.
It can be used to search for premesis by postcode or it can be used to display a list of premises, for example Multi Premise landlords.
It can also be used to add a new address or edit an existing address.

## Usage Examples

```markup
<nsx-address-selector postcode="AA12 3BB" addresses="arrayOfAddresses" allowmanualaddress></nsx-address-selector>
```
If the address selector hasn‚Äôt been provided with any addresses, it will start by asking for the user to enter their postcode.

You can [see the anonymous state of `<nsx-address-selector>` here](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/nucleus-experiences/demo/index.html?path=/story/nsx-address-selector--anonymous).

When the user enters a postcode, the component will dispatch a ‚Äòpostcode-selected‚Äô event.  At this point the component shows a ‚ÄúLoading‚Äù state until it is provided with a list of addresses.

When you set the addresses property of the component it will change state to display the addresses and ask the user to select one.

You can [see the multi address state of `<nsx-address-selector>` here](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/nucleus-experiences/demo/index.html?path=/story/nsx-address-selector--multi-addresses).

If there are 6 or more addresses then the component will display the addresses in a drop-down.

### Manual address

If the user presses "Ammend your address" or if the "manualformenabled" property is set to true the component will display a manual address form:
