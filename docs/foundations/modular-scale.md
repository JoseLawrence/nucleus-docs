# Modular scale

> The implementation of modular scale simplifies and beautifies our designs.

Scales are everywhere. Most notably in nature where the presence of the golden ratio can be found from the microscopic DNA's double helix to vast spiral galaxies.

[Tim Brown](https://tbrown.org/) describes how we may use modular scale in web design in his 2011 [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) article [More meaningful typography](https://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography/).

Taking this approach and applying it to our Structure, Typography, Spacing and extending into Iconography, Illustrations and further, we are able to define a hierarchy which is beautiful, calculable and concise.

## Viewports

### Scale
**1.5**

We have six [viewports](https://docs.britishgas.design/foundation/viewports), the smallest width being 320px. This is our initial value that all the other viewports are based from.

**320px is 1em**

Then we scale from here in increments of 1.5x as follows:

**320** x 1.5 = **480**  
**480** x 1.5 = **720**  
**720** x 1.5 = **1080**  
**1080** x 1.5 = **1620**  
**1620** x 1.5 = **2430**  

Read more about our [Viewports](https://docs.britishgas.design/foundation/viewports) and see our table of [Nucleus viewport sizes](https://docs.britishgas.design/foundation/viewports).

### Typography

For Typography, we have three multipliers to generate our scales.

**Major Second** = **1.125**  
**Minor Third** = **1.2**  
**Major Third** = **1.25**  

These are applied to our Viewport sizes in the following way:

‚ö™Ô∏è Polo & üèâ Rugby uses `Major Third`.  
üèë Hockey & üèÄ Basketball uses `Minor Third`.  
üéæ Tennis & üîµ Squash uses `Major Second`.
