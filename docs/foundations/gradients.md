# Gradients

## Introduction

We use gradients to add depth and richness to our brand. They can be used as bold backgrounds. Each gradient is created from two brand colours.

Gradients are 205Â° from one colour to the next, except for the gradient applied to `ns-cta` which runs vertically.

## Usage

Applying a gradient to `ns-panel` can create a feeling of depth and richness for a page. Each and every `ns-illustration` uses gradients as they are rich in colour and personality. The `hillside` variant of `ns-landmark` uses our gradients.

## Gradient colours

Within Storybook we have published the [gradient colour palette](https://britishgas.co.uk/nucleus/demo/index.html?path=/story/foundations-colours--gradient-pallette).
