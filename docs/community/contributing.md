### Insights on existing Nucleus assets

For any feedback related to our Nucleus components and related documentation, we're using Github. This helps us provide a transparent track of all contributions and potential issues, as well as tie these into our own backlog reviews.

1. You can view our [backlog](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues)
2. You'll be able to review all previous feedback soon. **We are yet to separate feedback from our backlog.**
3. You can create [bug reports](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&template=a--bug-report.md&title=), add a new [change request (RFC)](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=b--request-a-change.md&title=%5BRFC%5D), as well as react or comment on existing feedback.
4. We've prepared a template to structure incoming feedback, gather relevant insights, and help us respond accordingly
5. If and once an issue is picked up, we'll ask to meet you to swap ideas and listen to your insights or make use of weekly design critique sessions

### Suggestions for new Nucleus assets

We're working hard to grow Nucleus without sacrificing quality.

1. You can track and add suggestions for new assets in Github, following the same procedure as above
2. Feel free to explore the styles and assets provided to create new components if you have an urgent need and feel we can't respond fast enough
3. Please make sure to submit  your experiments and learning, as it helps us to track potential variations and roll out stable additions to all teams via Nucleus

### Feedback on anything else related to Nucleus

You can always reach us on Slack, via `#product-nucleus`. If there's anything on your mind, simply reach out!

### Events and updates

Having all these resources available anytime is great. But we don't think we can do without face-to-face sessions. Neither do we think that we have all the right answers. That's why we want to meet you in person, as well as connect you to other teams dealing with similar issues.
- We are hosting sessions and workshops focused on our current tasks as we go along, normally every Tuesday at 1:30pm.
- Just like other product teams, we're participating in weekly and monthly cross-team ceremonies.
