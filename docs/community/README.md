# Community

> Our design system is a living organism, one that reflects and evolves with our collective learning.

## What to expect?

The Nucleus team is responsible for curating and growing the design system. That means, just like you, we have a roadmap and priorities to meet. Luckily, one of these priorities is to be there to support you as you integrate Nucleus components into your roadmap.

The growth, and adoption of the Nucleus design system involves a steep learning curve for everyone. To help on this journey, we want to ensure we provide you with helpful and relevant resources. But it'll ultimately be you designing and developing your journeys with Nucleus components.

This is why we need your input.

> Whether it's using the resources provided by Nucleus or contributing to them, it's your turn now.
