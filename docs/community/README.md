# Community

> Our design system is a living organism, one that reflects and evolves with our collective learning.

## What to expect?

Our Nucleus team is ultimately responsible for curating and growing the design system. That means that like you, we have a roadmap and priorities to meet. Luckily, one of these priorities is to be there for you.

We assume you to be busy most of the time. The better the resources we provide, the more you can focus on creating great customer solutions and business outcomes. But exactly because of this, you'll be at the frontlines finding out what works and what doesn't.

This is why we need your input.

> Whether it's using the resources provided by Nucleus or contributing to them, it's your turn now.
