# Community

> Our design system is a living organism, one that reflects and evolves with our collective learning.

## What to expect?

The Nucleus team is responsible for driving the growth and adoption of the design system. This means we have a roadmap and priorities to meet. One of these priorities is to be there to support you in adopting Nucleus.

Everyone plays a part in creating a coherent, consistent and engaging customer experience.
To help do this, we want to ensure we provide everyone with helpful and relevant resources. If you would like to contribute to the Nucleus documentation please reach out to one of our team.

This is why we need your input.

> Whether it's using the resources provided by Nucleus or contributing to them, it's your turn now.
