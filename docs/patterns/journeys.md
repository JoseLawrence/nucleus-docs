# Introduction

A journey pattern is a reusable design solution which frequently occurs in the context of a customer journey.

They are made up of [Page types](https://docs.britishgas.design/page-types), [Experience patterns](https://docs.britishgas.design/patterns/experiences) and [Components](https://docs.britishgas.design/components). We provide guidance for each type of Journey pattern, with the objective of creating a consistent experience across our customer journeys.

They can increase consistency between similar customer experiences across all product journeys. Therefore the way our users interact with our brand becomes familiar irrespective of the need theyâ€™re fulfilling. For our designers and engineers they are another useful tool to allow them to focus on solving the complex user problems.
