# Introduction

Asking for information plays a key part in our customersâ€™ experience with British Gas. All functional journeys include elements of data capture and asking a customer to make a choice. Grouping questions, information, and choices together in logical and relatable sections can make our experiences as intuitive as possible.

## Landmark - Lakeside

The Landmark supports a sub-heading and heading, along with a single paragraph. You can use this to signpost the journey, and frame the context of the information you are asking the customer for.  

**Further research:** We are currently researching the use of `legends` and `labels` as headings, with the view that you would not need to use an `ns-landmark` to start each page.

## Grouping your questions

As expressed in the journey patterns documentation we advise that you approach each functional journey in the same way - breaking down the journey into smaller sections, asking the customer a single question or group of questions at a time. The idea is to reduce the cognitive load and help a customer complete what they need to do as efficiently as possible.

### Group by theme

Grouping questions together thematically can help a customer understand the context and objective of what you are asking. 

### Group by type of control

Radio buttons and checkboxes should be grouped in their own respective fieldsets. The legend should be used to provide context to the choice(s) a customer is being asked to make. Each form control should use their own label as the answer. 


## `ns-form`

The `ns-form` component is a wrapper used to contain all your form controls. Itâ€™s primary purpose within the design system is to manage the validations of your form controls. Semantically it sits at the top of the hierarchy.

## `ns-fieldset`

The `ns-fieldset` component is an element that sits directly in an `ns-form`. We use the fieldset to help group form controls such as inputs, radios, and checkboxes. Within the `fieldset` there is a `legend` element - this can help describe the form controls and provide context to the customer. 

It is unnecessary to use the `fieldset` and `legend` when presenting the customer with a single input field relating to one piece of information.
