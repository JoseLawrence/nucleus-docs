# Starting a Journey

### When to use this pattern.  

This pattern should be used to clarify a task for the user at the start of a functional journey. It sets expectations and provides any contextual information a user may need to complete their journey successfully. 

### When not to use this pattern.  

This pattern may not be needed in full if users are coming from a hub page where a task is already clearly clarified. This pattern may also vary in shorter journeys, particularly where form elements may need to be present at the first step.
 
### This step should include:  

| Key | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |

| B | A hillside landmark that clarifies the task at hand for the user. This should have a warm and welcoming tone |
| C | A short bulleted list to outline any information that the user needs to know to complete the journey. |
| D | A prominent direct call to action. |
| E | Links to relevant help and support content | 

### This step may also include:
