# Types of barriers

> Inclusivity and accessibility are fundamental. No one should be left out. Ever.

## Physical barriers
When designing experiences for users who have physical disabilities which impact their mobility, it is important to acknowledge the following:

* Provide shortcuts.
* Make large clickable actions.
* Give form fields space.
* Design with mobile and touch screen in mind.
* Design for keyboard or speech only use.

## Cognitive development

When designing experiences for users who have cognitive disabilities, it is important to acknowledge the following:

* Reading age may be lower.
* Busy page layout can be confusing (Keep it simple!).
* Ambiguous labels and icons can be confusing.
* Users may be easily distracted by moving animation.
* Short term memory may be affected.

## Hearing loss

When designing experiences for users who have hearing loss, it is important to acknowledge the following:

* Provide synchronised captions for all video content.
* Do not use audio features.
* Provide transcripts for all audio content.
* Deaf users require captions if the video does not make sense when the sound is turned off.

## Sight loss

When designing experiences for users who have sight loss, it is important to acknowledge the following:

* Contrast between text and the background may not be sufficient (W3C ratio 4.5:1).
* Text may not be large enough to read so would need to resize or zoom into content.
* Do not cause content to update elsewhere on screen after selecting an item.

Screen readers are used to translate written text into speech:

* All non-text elements (images, multimedia) require a text alternative.
* Visual structure must be represented in a logical order, use headings.
* Navigation must be obvious to users (scrolling content confusing).

## Permanent vs. temporary

Some barriers are permanent, some temporary. Suffering from an injury or illness can limit the use of a limb. Not being fluent in a language lowers our reading age. We might want to watch a video with its sound muted but not have any headphones at hand.

In fact, it's likely that all of us experience these barriers at some point in our lives. Whether temporary or permanent, we don't need to think that our abilities are any less than those of others. It's simply a different approach to getting on and taking action in our lives.
