# Contribute to documentation

## Introduction

> Our documentation is rather important. The more help we have the better it will be.

## Contributing to a page

Take a look at our design system documentation https://docs.britishgas.design

If you find something that you'd like to improve, change, adapt or remove; click the 'Edit on GitHub' link.

This will take you to the same page within our GitHub documentation repository https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus-docs.

Find the pencil icon and edit this file.


### Committing your changes

Once you've completed your amendments or additions, briefly describe your changes below the 'Commit changes' section.

Within the 'Name the branch' field to `update/filename` (where `filename` is the file you're changing.)

Click on the 'Commit changes' button.

This will create your branch and show the next step to 'Open a pull request'.

### Opening a pull request

Check the changes that have been made by comparing the existing file and your file.

Feel free to include a comment in the pull request, then click on 'Create pull request'.

Your pull request will be listed in our repository for review.

One of our team will review your pull request.

Once approved, the changes will be merged into our documentation and make their way to the page on https://docs.britishgas.design where it all began.

## Thank you

For every little change or improvement our documentation receives from our community, we promise to give a kitten a belly rub.
