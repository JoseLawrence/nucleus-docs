# Starting a Journey

### Introduction  

This page type should be used to clarify and set up a task for a user at the beginning of a functional journey.  

### Purpose

This page sets expectations and provides any contextual information that a user may need to complete their journey successfully. A dedicated setup page may not be needed in full if users are coming from a hub page if their task is already clearly clarified. This page may also vary in shorter journeys, particularly where form elements may need to be present at the first step.
 
### This page should include:  

| Key | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| A | A navigational subtitle or topic reference to orient your user.|
| B | A hillside landmark that clarifies the task at hand for the user. This should have a warm and welcoming tone |
| C | A short bulleted list to outline any information that the user needs to know to complete the journey. |
| D | A prominent direct call to action. |
| E | Links to relevant help and support content | 

### This page may also include:

| F | Signposting to a secondary journey or action for frequently misdirected users  |
