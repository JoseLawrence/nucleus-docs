# Start

## Introduction

This page type should be used to clarify and set up a task for a user at the beginning of a journey.

## Purpose

This page sets expectations and provides any contextual information that a user may need to complete their journey successfully. A dedicated start page may not be needed in full if users are coming from a hub page if their task is already clearly clarified. This page may also vary in shorter journeys, particularly where form elements may need to be present at the first step.

### This page should include

| Key | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| A | A navigational subtitle or topic reference to orient your user.|
| B | A hillside landmark that clarifies the task at hand for the user. This should have a warm and welcoming tone |
| C | A short bulleted list to outline any information that the user needs to know to complete the journey. |
| D | A prominent direct call to action. |

### This page may also include

| Key | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- |
| E | Links to relevant help and support content |
| F | Signposting to a secondary journey or action for frequently misdirected users | 

This supplementary content may be displayed further down the page as needed, with hierarchical importance reducing with scroll depth. Decorative background elements should be adapted to create balance with the surrounding page elements.

Example: Start (A - E)
