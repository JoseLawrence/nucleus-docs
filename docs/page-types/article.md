## Introduction

Article pages are used to inform the user about something. They can take the form of a blog or news item and have been specifically designed to make it easy for the reader to absorb, utilising a short distance for their eyes to pan horizontally. Articles are typically read from start to finish.

They allow long form content with images and sections, with very little effort required for achieving the layout of the page, meaning it is an ideal format for regular updates and breaking news where speed of release is important. They can be effective marketing tools if written in a certain way and can also be a useful as an SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) tool, helping to drive traffic to the site.

## Purpose

* To promote news, blog or marketing.
* A quick and easy way to create a page where speed of release is important.
* Help the website have fresh and regularly updated content.
* To gain and develop the user's interest in a topic that could lead to an action.

## Content guidance

Write content in a way such as to grab attention, create interest, sell the benefits and make the person reading desire something. Then provide a call to action for them. Use bullet points or numbered lists to help convey important points to note.

| Page&nbsp;composition | Description and code |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![Image of header](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78355810/121555708-250d1f00-ca0b-11eb-86b9-df4a65ccfb60.png) | This page will always start with [nsx-header](/components/nsx-header.md) providing the primary navigation for the website, whilst also being our main brand presence. |
|  | h1 - using a compelling but concise headline that would make someone want to click through if seen as a link elsewhere |
|  | A relative 16:9 [ns-image](/components/ns-image.md) with a caption to grab attention and sell the story - it should convey the headline and the caption should describe the image |
|  | Following that there is the main body of content, which can be made up from h2-h6 and paragraph text, links, lists, further images and captions and CTAs. It can also be broken in to sections (like chapters) indicated by the triple dots.  |
| ![Image of Footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78355810/121567323-57704980-ca16-11eb-9951-598055b9808c.png) | Finally, there is [nsx-footer](/components/nsx-footer.md) which holds all required links and copyright information for the website. It is also an important SEO tool as it includes links to social channels and our mobile apps. |
