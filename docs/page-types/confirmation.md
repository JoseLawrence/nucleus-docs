# Confirmation

## Introduction

The confirmation page type is used to show a customer that their journey or task has been completed.

## Purpose

The purpose of the confirmation page is to show customer that their action has been completed. It is important to differentiate this from their previous steps so they know there is a clear change.

## Content Guidance

The page should always begin with a clear completion message. Any key information the customer needs to remember or save for a later date should be presented back to them at the top of the page. 

Examples of this include:

- any reference numbers
- an appointment date and/or time
- a start or end date, or duration of a product or service
- an address or contact information

The page should also set the customer's expectations. Whether they have purchased a new product or service, or arranged an appointment with an engineer. You can use supporting content to playback their purchase and inform them of what will happen next. If the customer is required to complete any additional follow up tasks then they should be highlighted as close to the top of the page as possible.

Supplementary content relating to their completed journey can be displayed further down the page, with hierarchical importance reducing with scroll depth. If you believe there is related tasks that meet their next best action, then these can be highlighted with a primary call to action.

In addition to this page, a confirmation email containing this information should be sent to the customer as well. This is especially important if the customer cannot bookmark or revisit this page once they navigated away from it.
