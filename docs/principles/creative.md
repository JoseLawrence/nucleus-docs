# Creative principles

> Creative principles are an expression of our brand, and of our visual identity in particular

Our story can be told in many different ways. With such a broad range of experiences we offer, we need to express ourselves in a consistent way across all our channels.

Our creative principles allow us to express our identity, to tell our story, predominantly in a visual way but also through a conveying the right feeling.

It's also clear that it takes some thought and purposeful design to carry through our creative principles in practice. Use the guidance here to clarify the  purpose and measure the outcomes.

## Modern and dynamic

Weâ€™re a brand full of energy. Being modern and dynamic helps us lead the way to change how things are done in our industry, making sure our customers always feel in control. Our Superflame graphic shows our dynamism in high-impact communications, and our colour palette is adaptable for whatever weâ€™re talking about.

### What makes it modern and dynamic?

It has energy

- We use our different assets to make our content feel more alive
- We pick the right assets to hero our brand, direct users, and help our content flow

It is layered

- Build up the different assets and content in layers and groups for depth
- Subtle layering helps to make it feel richer without becoming overwhelming

It is fluid

- Break out of the grid and containing panels to create a more varied rhythm

### Do's and Don'ts

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Think asymmetrical**  Use a golden ratio of 3:5 when aligning assets | **Always center**  It can quickly become too monotonous |
| **Break out of the grid**  Visually break straight lines by combining our assets | **Overload assets**  Layer our assets, but one too many can tip it over the edge |
| **Create flow**  Add visual movement by using assets to flow and lead users down the page | **Become too blocky**  Aim to create variety and break any repetitiveness |

## Clean and fresh

At our heart, weâ€™re a blue and white brand. Being clean and fresh helps us show our content simply, so our customers can get what they need â€“ and get on with their day. We use white space in a considered way so theyâ€™re never overwhelmed. While icons and infographics make complex information crystal clear.

### What makes it clean and fresh?

It is considered

- Only show users what they need, when they need it
- Take away the unnecessary and give users the option to delve deeper if they want to

It has highlights

- Focus into and draw attention to the key information or action

It is balanced

- Contrast clean and fresh assets with assets that are more human, playful, and rich

### Dos and don'ts

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simplify the complex**  Have just what you need and no more | **Clutter the page**  Think about the space, if you want to fill the canvas or be more compact |
| **Frame and focus**  Focus on one key message or assets and use others to help support | **Be cold**  We are a blue brand but always aim to add warmth |
| **Considered typography**  Give bold typography space to breathe and change up the pace down the page | **Be boring**  There are always ways to add interest to break up heavy content |

## Warm and friendly

Weâ€™re a brand with clarity, but weâ€™re never clinical. Being warm and friendly helps us make a genuine connection with our customers. Our imagery of Wilbur builds an engaging story. And we use natural photography of customers and engineers to put our work in an everyday context.

### What makes it warm and friendly?



It feels natural

- We use tighter crops of our photography for added focus
- We pepper in our secondary colours
- We use softer gradients and shadows

It has texture

- We have added details to our base elements, bringing them together for richness
- We bring photography to life by layering over our graphical assets or typography

It is contextual

- We go rich, engaging, functional, or minimal, depending on the [purpose](https://centrica.frontify.com/r/jmWK0vSYlZD1r980jDCf_iwljZbvaeHIbY67XEyDDIk,)

### Dos and don'ts

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Look and sound real**  Reflect real life in the way we talk and visually connect our stories | **Be too repetitive**  Don't use the the same component more than one unless in a set |
| **Think organic**  Some of our assets are organic in nature, and help balance the structured ones | **Feel flat**  Create depth with layering and shadows so we're not one dimensional |
