# Accessibility principles

> At minimum, features must conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at Level AA

Accessibility ensures that all persons can access and benefit from a website, system or application, regardless of their gender, age, culture, or ability. Considerations must also be made around different screen sizes, browser types and settings, or those who do not have plug-ins such as Flash.

The four accessibility principles (POUR) are derived straight from [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). For each principle, WCAG provides in-depth documentation and guidance. Below, we've restated the principles as well as provided bit of background into Level AA conformance.

## Perceivable

- Users must be able to perceive that information is available
- nformation becomes invisible if it can't be perceived with any available senses

## Operable

- Users must be able to operate the interface
- An action becomes unattainable if it relies on an interaction that a user cannot perform

## Understandable

- Users must be able to understand both the information and interface provided
- A piece of content or operation becomes a burden if it goes beyond a users understanding

## Robust

- Users relying on user agents, including assistive technologies, must be served with compatible content
- A piece of content or operation needs to be compatible with evolving user agents, including assistive technologies, browsers, and other applications involved in rendering content

## Conformance with the principles

To rate how well an instance conforms to the principles, [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#perceivable) provides three three conformance levels:

  1. **A is viewed as the minimum level** of requirement which all websites, apps, and electronic content such as documents should adhere to.
  2. **AA is viewed as the acceptable level of accessibility** for many online services, which should work with most assistive technology which is now widely available on both desktop and mobile devices, or which can be purchased as a third-party installation.
  3. **AAA compliance is viewed as the gold standard** level of accessibility, which provides everything for a complete accessible offering, including all the bells and whistles which make the difference between a very good experience and an excellent one.
  
  Our aim is to ensure **Level AA conformance**. Within Nucleus, this means that any new component needs to meet related criteria. However, content will change with each application of a component. To ensure accessibility, our product teams will need to consider both visible content and its counterparts used by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
  
  In-depth documentation on accessibility straight from the source can be found in [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#location). Because each level of conformance includes 'lower' levels, any specific requirement labeled as A or AA applies to us.
