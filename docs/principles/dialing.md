# Dialing our creative principles

> When we use our creative principles in practice, we think in terms of "how much": How much should each come across? Which one should we emphasise in this case?

## Uniform but not repetitive

All three principles should always be represented but at varying levels. We start from 'less' to 'more' to 'most', considering the desired impact. This helps us build in subtle variations.  

This thinking can be applied on a deep, component level or a page, or journey level. We recommend starting from the very bottom and building up from there. When consideration has been given to all the smaller details, it often results in a more meaningful big picture.

## Purpose driven design

Our design decisions should always be firmly based on what the customer needs, whilst also balancing our business goals and a need to express our brand personality. That is where purpose driven design comes in. It allows us to design beyond just the aesthetic, it's about meaningful interaction and access to information.

### Dialing our creative principles based on purpose:

Firstly, ask yourself what is the main thing customers want to do or should take away?

Is the purpose to navigate the site? Is it promotion and awareness of a product and service? Is it purely functional, such as a form? Is the core goal to inform, there to provide details and breakdown information? We've identified five key purposes below that seem to fit most circumstances. As we evolve Nucleus we may need to add more and welcome any input.

#### 1. To represent our brand

For this purpose, all three of our creative principles are dialed high. We want to connect with our customers and for them to welcome us into their homes. We can use our most dynamic and recognisable brand assets to convey energy and be forward-thinking. Maximising our principles we want to create emotional impact while keeping things visually clean and simple.

***Most*** - Modern and dynamic*

***Most*** - Warm and friendly*

***More*** - Clean and fresh*

#### 2. To promote

When promoting our products or services, we want to engage the customer as much as possible. We want to use visuals and photography to capture attention, along with a meaningful message to bring it all together. Because we are essentially â€˜sellingâ€™ ourselves, we need to soften that message and dial up our warm and friendly principle as the highest.

***Most*** - Warm and friendly*

***More*** - Clean and fresh*

***More*** - Modern and dynamic*

#### 3. To navigate

Navigation is crucial. Being clear with the actions and utilising icons will help to visually guide the user. For any navigation to not feel flat, there is opportunity to be dynamic with interactions, or to add a touch of warmth with colour, shapes or animation.

***Most*** - Modern and dynamic*

***Most*** - Clean and fresh*

***Some*** - Warm and friendly*

#### 4. To inform

When digesting information we want it to be clear and easy to understand. However that doesn't mean it have to be boring. We can add helpful visuals, using cutout photography and add warmth with how we explain things.

***Most*** - Clean and fresh

***Some*** - Modern and dynamic*

***Some*** - Warm and friendly*

#### 5. As functional

Functional elements refer to something that is needed for a specific use or to perform a task. They serve a function and so require interaction from the user. Something such as forms need to be simple and clear, in design and in usage. Adding visual interest or interaction would be useful here to off set it's static nature. Keep in mind this isn't a place to fluff about so warm and friendly is the lowest, however it can still come through by using gradients or illustrations.

***Most*** - Clean and fresh*

***More*** - Modern and dynamic*

***Some*** - Warm and friendly*

## Flexing the creative principles
Naturally the primary principle you want to convey will be the highest dial. However, you may choose a supporting principle that might be the lowest dial and not the second. This gives us flex and range in how we use our assets.

Think about the content and context of the design in what you want to convey and let that guide your decisions.

## Choose core assets for your design

Look at the assets we have that naturally fit into your primary principle. You could start by choosing 3 or 4 core assets and build the design from there.

Our assets and creative principles are very much dials that you can tweak to suit the needs and purpose of the design. Use your best judgement to determine when something is too much or too little. Look to our exemplar examples and foundation usage to help guide you.

### Our assets

The list below is a general overview and include tangible and non-tangible types. Assets can be fluid belonging to different principles depending on how you use them. You can also combine assets to create new meanings. It's also possible to be break them down further into types such as â€˜emotiveâ€™ photography if you want to get more granular.

> It is good to note that some assets are universal such as typography for content, and our primary colours, and would usually be present regardless.

## Design quality assurance

### To assure quality in our designs:

- Read and understand our creative principles
- Understand the usage of each foundational asset
- Understand how our assets come together to express our creative principles
- Ensure youâ€™re not designing a component that already exists to meet that purpose
- Seek opinions and feedback from your peers to assess your purpose and use of creative principles
- Understand that if you need to deviate from any of our guidelines you take accountability for updating any affected teams or frameworks

We are looking to create the following, in the future for further support:
