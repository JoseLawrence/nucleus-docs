# Intro

> Principles capture our shared values

## Why do we have principles?

Principles are definitions based on hard-won insights. They allow us to...

- Use a consistent vision that we all work towards
- Help us concentrate on creating consistent and coherent experiences
- Root down shared success criteria for decision making and prioritisation
- Be flexible to change

Principles work only when they are consistently applied across our various teams. However, while their definition should remain relatively stable, how to best apply them changes with each task. That's both the difficult and exciting part of working with shared principles!

## What's the best use for the principles?

Most of the time, our product teams will be working on specific challenges to meet short and medium term targets. Our principles go beyond that to provide shared, long-term targets.

A key activity for us  is to come up with new, alternative solutions time and time again to see what works best. Some of these solutions might be solid solutions in their own right but not quite fit the desired experience, accessibility criteria, or visual language we're aiming for as British Gas. Identifying these differences is not always easy, but that's where principles can be of use to your team.

Use principles...

- In ideation to provide constructive constraints
- In user research and testing to learn how these principles might best be met
- During design and sprint reviews as shared evaluation criteria
- As metrics to provide cross-team, cross-journey data
- In analytics to track changes over time

## Which set of principles should we follow?

We have multiple sets of principles, with a slightly different perspectives. Ideally, this helps us to keep them at an appropriate level: high-level enough to unleash your creativity and defined enough to provide purpose driven outcomes. 

As a rule of thumb, we encourage you to refer to the shared principles often, the better to learn their meaning in practice. In order to pick the right set of principles, please consider what you're working on:

1. To ensure all of our current and potential customers have equal access and are able to complete journeys to satisfaction, dive into [accessibility principles](https://centrica.frontify.com/r/lUEdXVvtfufWGAcMq883LHr3USn390x6etw4LsVD3k4,)
2. To work on what the journey is going to feel like, dive into [experience principles](https://centrica.frontify.com/r/fJzwMc-z1kyAy-jwTKeIAj4c00hwAnTW19gZDuSC0jQ,)
3. To ensure the visual language reflects our brand, dive into [creative principles](https://centrica.frontify.com/r/VdzYOA3vy4NAT6r1rehm-6X5Q6InAo3cCGoU_e3NxVo,)
