# Experience principles

> Our experience principles were born iteratively, working closely with our DesignOps team.

Our five experience principles describe the core values that underpin our Nucleus Design System. They are the foundations that we measure ourselves against and which we hold ourselves accountable to.

## Tailored to individuals

We tailor our experiences to the individuality of each customer and channel they might appear in. We use data and insights to understand our customers’ needs and use personalisation and smart technologies to predict and act, not react.

Examples of how it works:

* If we know a customer’s name, we prefill their details.
* We don’t promote products customer’s already have.
* We don’t use a "cookie-cutter" to create our designs. We create for the purpose, the customer, the device and the outcome.

## Leave no one out

Inclusivity and accessibility are fundamental. No one should be left out. Ever.

Examples of how it works:

* If in doubt, test it in the lab.
* Consider how the page will be read.
* Consider how you are writing – would you say this to your mum?.
* Our code and content are optimised for screen readers.
* Learn about different types of barriers (physical, cognitive, sensory limitations that can be either temporary or permanent).

## Always there

The relationship we have with our customers is a two-way conversation.  We listen, we don’t just talk and look to offer reassurance and expertise whenever and however our customers might need it.

Examples of how it works:

* Guides, tool-tips and fast-serving links so customers have all the info they need.
* Use our Tone of Voice to sound human, reassuring and helpful.
* Webchat when a customer hesitates.

## Make life simple

Our products and experiences should be simple, seamless and hassle-free.

We create them this way so our customers have time to get on with what’s important in their lives.

Examples of how it works:

* Take steps out where possible and strip-back.
* Focus on one message at a time.
* Keep messages concise and clear.
* Our designs are intuitive and our back-end systems do the 'thinking' – so customers shouldn’t have to.

## Go beyond

We always go further than creating functional experiences by seeking out surprise and delight for our customers.

Examples of how it works:

* The smallest gesture can make the biggest differences.
* Look at an experience end to end and understand where customers have come from and where they are going, and what state of mind they are in!.
* Terms & Conditions written in simple terms.
* Using thoughtful animation at the right time to add delight.
