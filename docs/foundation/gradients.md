# Gradients

## Introduction

Gradients are used to add depth and richness to our brand. They can be used as bold backgrounds. Each gradient is created from two core colours.

Gradients are 105Â° from one colour to the next except for the `Action` gradient.

## Usage

Gradients create a feeling of depth and richness.
