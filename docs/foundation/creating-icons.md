# Creating icons

## Principles

1. Make sure that a similar icon is not already in use
2. Think about the icon you want to create and which category it fits in
3. Use the icon grid to ensure consistency with existing icons
4. Make sure icon works across different sizes
5. Remember to create both solid and outline versions of your icon (Use solid over outline, unless icon is interactive)
6. Use a consistent stroke thickness based on sizes (Use at least 2px for stroke to avoid odd resizing issues or using fills with strokes)
7. Design clean and simple forms using our shapes
8. Use flat shapes over 3d forms
9. Rounded corners should make an icon feel friendly, not childish

## The icon grid

We use a grid for icon creation to give consistency across our icons. You should also be considering where your paths sit, to be as close to pixel perfect as possible. Here are examples of the grid and basic shapes to show it's usage:

<img src="/assets/grid.jpg" width="25%" align="left" border="4" alt="Grid for creating icons" />
<img src="/assets/grid-vertical.jpg" width="25%" align="left" border="4" alt="Grid with vertical highlight for creating icons" />
<img src="/assets/grid-horizontal.jpg" width="25%" align="left" border="4" alt="Grid with horizontal highlight for creating icons" />
<img src="/assets/grid-circle.jpg" width="25%" align="left" border="4" alt="Grid with circle highlight for creating icons" />


## Sizing

Icons are created using illustrator with a 32px x 32px art-board. This allows scaling both up and down of the icon’s size. It is important to check your icons across different sizes during creation. The Nucleus Design System scales across different screen sizes meaning elements, including the icon’s scale to retain their visual proportions. We recommend checking your icon works between 16px and 72px.

## Technical bit

### Exporting icons for developers

Once you’re icons are completed (and signed off!) they need to be made ready for development. Follow these steps to a happy developer:

1. Make sure your icon is set to black
2. Select the icon and choose Object > Expand appearance
3. Then using the top menu select File > Export > Export for Screens and export the icon to .svg file type.
