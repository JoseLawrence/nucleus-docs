# Types of photography

## Aspect ratios

We have three aspect ratios, 1:1, 4:3 and 16:9, which we use in various ways. Take a considered approach and do not overload with too many variants.

Two of our core aspect ratios 1:1 and 16:9.

## Responsive rules

For all of our aspect ratios, our rule is that all images scale proportionally to their ratio. This means that they will retain their shape from large screens to small ones.

Our aspect ratios always scale proportionally.

# Our image library

When selecting photography think about the subject matter and the customer benefit you want to convey. This is made stronger when paired with copy that links the story together.

Our library can be accessed [here](https://centrica.frontify.com/d/pDUbkrcf54Nh/our-assets). Please refer to our brand guidelines for more further details on photography selection and art direction.
