# Colour accessibility

Good colour contrast assists people with sight loss, including colour blindness, as well as people with cognitive disabilities when viewing content.

Our components follow the two main rules of accessibility as it relates to colour:

1. We never use colour as the only means of providing information or requesting an action
2. The combinations of text and their background colours do not fall below the [WCAG recommended threshold ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) of 4.5:1 for standard or small text and 3:1 for larger text
