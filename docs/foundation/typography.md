## Sizes

> A universal typographic system which is consistent and efficient to use for both developers and designers.

We've implemented the following modular scale to inform our typographic hierarchy.

A double stranded scale for each set of typographic sizes using two bases.


1em (16px)  
1.375em (22px)

The result of which is:

### Heading

| -- | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |

## Semantics vs. styles

The definitions we have covered here refer to typographic styles. It's important understand the separation of visual directions and encoded semantics:

- Encoded semantics are used to define hierarchy and relationships, making text programmatically legible for screen readers and other assistive technologies
- Visual directions like the ones outlined here are used to ensure optimal readability and legibility, as well as convey a specific brand

Without semantically correct HTML, our content won't be accessible  Consider for example the following guidance on headings:

- The page headings must follow an order, starting from H1 to H6
- A page must only have one H1 element

... and a suitable style may be applied on each of these headings. To avoid confusion, please remember the following:

- Refer to H1, H2, etc. only when it comes to semantic choices and accessibility
- Use Nucleus naming conventions to discuss typographic style choices
