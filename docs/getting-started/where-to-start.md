# Where to start?

> To get you up and running with Nucleus, we've prepared the following list.

## Bookmark this site

To create a coherent, accessible experience for everyone.

## Our documentation

This site serves as a learning resource [docs.britishgas.design](https://docs.britishgas.design/), come back to it when you need it. We don't expect you to know everything but do take time to study it.

The more familiar you are the better. It will serve you well when you're faced with a complicated situation.

## Join our Slack channel

The easiest way to stay updated on what's going on is to join our Slack channel, [\#product-nucleus](https://centricadigital.slack.com/messages/CCQDEPKBJ).

## Be a champion

Nucleus is one of the many initiatives that will help us create ever better outcomes, but it will all amount to nothing without you.

Adopting Nucleus will require learning some new habits and letting go of old ones. We'll be doing our best to make sure it's an easy transition to make.

## Get the Sketch Library

You can get our Nucleus Sketch Library via Github. The step-by-step instructions can be found [here](https://centrica.frontify.com/d/d5BuWPqlVMmG/design-tools#/design-tools/our-sketch-library).

**Please note**: As we're transitioning to the latest evolution of our visual identity, we'll have two UI libraries living side-by-side for some time:

**Centrica UX Sketch Library** (to be fazed out):

* for now, contains a broader set of styles and assets.
* allows you to test out the proposed structure for this (and the upcoming Nucleus) library.

**Nucleus Sketch Library** (to be ramped up):

* containing the latest styles, including new grid.
* contains a first set of shared components, as covered by Nucleus.
* starting small and growing over time.
* allows you to explore the latest evolution of our visual identity.

We trust your team will be able to make an informed decision on when to use each during this time of transition.

We think Nucleus is one of the many initiatives that will help us create ever better outcomes. But it will all amount to nothing without you. Adopting Nucleus might require some new habits, or letting go of old ones. We'll be doing our best to make sure it's an easy transition to make.
