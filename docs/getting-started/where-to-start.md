# Where to start?

> To get you up and running with Nucleus.

## Our vision

To create a coherent, accessible experience for everyone.

## Our documentation

This site serves as a learning resource [docs.britishgas.design](https://docs.britishgas.design/), come back to it when you need it. We don't expect you to know everything but do take time to study it.

The more familiar you are the better. It will serve you well when you're faced with a complicated situation.

## Join our Slack channel

The easiest way to stay updated on what's going on is to join our Slack channel, [\#product-nucleus](https://centricadigital.slack.com/messages/CCQDEPKBJ).

## Be a champion

Nucleus is one of the many initiatives that will help us create ever better outcomes, but it will all amount to nothing without you.

Adopting Nucleus will require learning some new habits and letting go of old ones. We'll be doing our best to make sure it's an easy transition to make.

## Who is it for?

Nucleus is for anybody who is involved in shaping our digital real estates.

### For front-end developers

In addition to the shared principles, you will be able to use already tested, plug-and-play front-end components. Design mock-ups and prototypes are great for exploring what would be desirable, but in our digital world, it's the fully developed assets that put feasibility to the test. We hope that with a growing body of re-usable assets and knowledge, you'll be able to tackle the tough issues, explore more alternative flows and solutions to realise the right one, together with your team.

### For designers

Many of us are proud of our craft and eye for details. But if we can't use these skills to truly impact the lives of our end users for the better, we'll have failed in one of our key objectives. We hope that if you have to worry less about finding the latest guidelines, or making the smallest tweak possible to get an idea through, you'll be able to spend more time exploring alternative flows, collaborating, and learning to build a strong case for your team's proposals.

#### Get the Sketch Library

Here are the [step-by-step instructions to download and install the Nucleus Sketch Library](https://centrica.frontify.com/d/d5BuWPqlVMmG/design-tools#/design-tools/our-sketch-library).

### For product owners

While you might not need an in-depth understanding of our shared UI styles and components, understanding the principles and requirements behind them is a strength when you're reviewing current proposals and discussing work ahead. We also hope that if ever needed, you'll nudge your product team to collaborate with others to address thorny issues and to test alternative combinations of existing assets before resolving to build custom, once-off components. After all, we expect the former to lead to better results for our business in the long run.

### For business analysts

We're working towards an evidence driven and purposeful use of UI components. If you think an asset of ours is performing particularly well or poorly in a certain context, kindly let us know. It will help us curate our shared assets and documentation for the better.

### For content managers

To hurry an update through, things sometimes get squeezed in where they shouldn't. We hope that with shared documentation and tools available, you'll see less of this taking place. One means for this change will be our growing body of shared, brand aligned, plug and play assets. Another one will be tools like Storybook that help us stress test and collaborate on copy with more ease. We also know that changing workflows takes some time and practice. To get there faster, we hope you'll also study the guidance provided here, the better to suggest alternative solutions when needed.
