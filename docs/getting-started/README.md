# Getting started

## Nucleus

Nucleus first came into being in 2018. During the first months, we set up a core team and went through an incubation stage. In 2019, we've moved into a stage of growth and early adoption.

### Our vision

> A design system that unites our business and allows us to create a coherent, engaging experience for our customers.

#### What does this mean in practice?

In order to realize this vision, our Nucleus product team is...

* taking in brand and accessibility guidelines.
* working with product teams to identify proven assets and related insights.
* looking for the shared, unifying concepts behind these.
* creating and curating high-quality, plug-and-play UI components and styles for product teams to use.
* establishing processes and tools that enable us to roll out updates to these assets easily.
* introducing ways for others to contribute to Nucleus, as well as flag any potential issues.
* following up on our adoption and impact.
* ensuring our communication is clear and usable for the product teams.
* building a community to sustain these processes.

### Why does this matter?

The better we succeed at making it easier for individuals and teams to learn about what it takes to create experiences that feel uniquely and genuinely British Gas, to better we will be able to...

* truly represent our brand identity across our digital, customer-facing solutions.
* reduce repetitive work, especially when it comes to design and front end development.
* reduce design and maintenance debt that tends to slow down updates.
* enable teams to focus on high value, creative work to solve problems and identify opportunities.

> It's a system of concepts. It embodies our collective knowledge and shared values.

### Who is it for?

#### For front-end developers

In addition to the shared principles, you will be able to use already tested, plug-and-play front-end components. Design mock-ups and prototypes are great for exploring what would be desirable, but in our digital world, it's the fully developed assets that put feasibility to the test. We hope that with a growing body of re-usable assets and knowledge, you'll be able to tackle the tough issues, explore more alternative flows and solutions to realise the right one, together with your team.

#### For designers

Many of us are proud of our craft and eye for details. But if we can't use these skills to truly impact the lives of our end users for the better, we'll have failed in one of our key objectives. We hope that if you have to worry less about finding the latest guidelines, or making the smallest tweak possible to get an idea through, you'll be able to spend more time exploring alternative flows, collaborating, and learning to build a strong case for your team's proposals.

#### For product owners

While you might not need an in-depth understanding of our shared UI styles and components, understanding the principles and requirements behind them is a strength when you're reviewing current proposals and discussing work ahead. We also hope that if ever needed, you'll nudge your product team to collaborate with others to address thorny issues and to test alternative combinations of existing assets before resolving to build custom, once-off components. After all, we expect the former to lead to better results for our business in the long run.

#### For business analysts

We're working towards an evidence driven and purposeful use of UI components. If you think an asset of ours is performing particularly well or poorly in a certain context, kindly let us know. It will help us curate our shared assets and documentation for the better.

#### For content managers

To hurry an update through, things sometimes get squeezed in where they shouldn't. We hope that with shared documentation and tools available, you'll see less of this taking place. One means for this change will be our growing body of shared, brand aligned, plug and play assets. Another one will be tools like Storybook that help us stress test and collaborate on copy with more ease. We also know that changing workflows takes some time and practice. To get there faster, we hope you'll also study the guidance provided here, the better to suggest alternative solutions when needed.

> Nucleus is for anybody who is involved in shaping our digital real estates.
