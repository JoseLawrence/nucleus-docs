# Introduction

> To get you up and running with Nucleus.

## Our vision

To create a coherent, accessible experience for everyone.

## What is a design system?

_“A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.”_

- InVision’s Design Systems Handbook

## Why do we have a design system?

Nucleus exists so we can efficiently design consistent and accessible experiences for our customers. Each element of the design system has been rigorously researched, designed, built and tested, to conform with our principles. By completing this discovery work, we hope that everyone is able to concentrate on creating consistent and coherent experiences for our customers. 

## How has the design system been created?

The Nucleus design system is built using Atomic Design Principles: 

* Atoms - individual elements such as colours, typographic styles, buttons and form fields
* Molecules - by combining atoms you make molecules; such as combining a form field and a button. 
* Organisms - complex series of combined atoms - such as the navigation - which is a collection of individual links, images, text and colours. 

For more information on this subject we would recommend reading _“Atomic Design”_ by Brad Frost - (https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
